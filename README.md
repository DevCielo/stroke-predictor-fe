## Project Description
The frontend of the **Stroke Predictor Web App** is built using React. It provides users with an interactive interface where they can input medical data and receive predictions about their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. This project aims to give users a clean and responsive interface for interacting with the machine learning model hosted in the backend. I created this project to learn how to deploy machine learning models on a web app using Flask.

## Backend
Backend can be found at: https://github.com/DevCielo/stroke-predictor-be

## Features
- Responsive UI built with React.
- Easy input form for medical data.
- Integration with Flask backend API to get stroke prediction results.
- Clean and modern design with simple navigation.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

    git clone https://github.com/DevCielo/stroke-predictor-web-app-fe
    cd stroke-predictor-web-app-frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
